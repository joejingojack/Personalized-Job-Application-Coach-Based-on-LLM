Embark on a journey to master the integration of cutting-edge large language model (LLM) into user-friendly applications.

I will start by gaining hands-on experience with Gradio, creating a simple yet powerful sample application. As I dive deeper, I will unlock the potential of watsonx.ai’s large language model, learning how to harness its power for real-world applications. By the end of this project, I will be adept at developing three specialized tools: an AI-driven resume enhancer, a personalized cover letter generator, and a strategic job hunting advisor.
